# Welcome

## Introduction

This is a tutorial created for the CSE212 (Data Structures) Class at Brigham
Young University - Idaho. It is meant to be a demonstration of my knowledge of what
I've learned throughout the course. It may be freely used or contributed to under
the MIT and CC-BY-SA 4.0 licenses. This is not meant to be a fully comprehensive
tutorial; it assumes the reader is at least somewhat proficient in Python and
basic object oriented programming principles.

This tutorial may often take advantage of features unique or most prominent in Python.
If something seems unfamiliar, liberally use the
[official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
It's a great resource and has it's
[own tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
for data structures that are native to the language and how they may differ from other
languages.
